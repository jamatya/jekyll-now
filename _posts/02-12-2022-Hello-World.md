Jekyll is a static site generator used to create websites that exist as a directory of files. Because Jekyll is used to create static sites instead of dynamic ones, there are some helpful advantages that come along with using it:

Static sites do not require an extensive back end, which allows for quicker and simpler development.

Due to the lack of server side scripts, the security of a jekyll site is far more apparent than that of a dynamic page. Because all of the files are created and collected upon launch there is little room for hacker threat to the sites infrastructure.
There are also some Disadvantages to using a static site as well

Because static sites cannot pull data from a standard database, the content within the site will always need to be edited manually. This requires some programming experience on the developer's end in able to edit content.

In addition to manually editing files in able to make changes, and depending on your changes multiple files may need to be edited. Just as the step before, YMMV depending on your programming experience.

For a visual representation of the power of Jekyll, here are some sites that were created with it:
